# ENGG1000 CSE Robot Sumo & Rescue
## Team PhatBoi - 2016s1

Engineering Design and Innovation (ENGG1000) is a first-year engineering course where students experience the process of designing and building creative solutions to solve problems. This repository is our team's code for two ENGG1000 projects:

### Robot Sumo
Two robots construction from LEGO Mindstorm EV3 kits are placed in a sumo ring where they battle it out to remain in the ring. Code for the operation of the robot and its sensors written in Python.

### Robot Rescue
The robot is placed in a maze in which it must traverse to find a victim (a coloured can) and carry it back to the robot's starting position. A small-scale model of rescuing trapped victims in a building following an earthquake.
